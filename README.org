#+title: ReadMe

* ~.dotconfigs~
This repo contains my personal config files , feel free to use it as a base template (do be warned it is quite messy)

Most of it has been chopped from other config files

* Why did i make a repo for this?
If i ever want to reinstall arch it would be a pain to start from scratch , this repo should minimize most of the pain
